## Let's get emotional, we already got physical..

In our data story we explore conflicts all over the world and the public attention they receive. We harness the huge GDELT 2.0 dataset consisting of events collected every day from thousands media channels of the world's news. The GDELT contains various features about the particular events including the sentiment analysis of the news sources. We focus mostly on the emotions conflicts tend to arouse with respect to their distinct features. The questions we ask are whether some regions are payed more attention than others, if news articles get more emotionally involved in conflicts occuring closer to our homes, or whether we tend to depict particular regions, nations or ethnicities by some steady emotional patterns. Throughout our research we hope to lift the shroud of how equally media report on the worlds conflicts and whether some sentiment bias exists. As the public is nowadays heavily influenced by (social) media and emotions affect us often heavier than the pure facts, we believe it is an important task to investigate how our news sources work with such a power they have upon us.

### How large is our circle of empathy?
Are we emotionally biased? Do the number of conflicts or their distance from our home define our emotions? 

### Do we care about all?
Are some countries ignored in the news? Is the number of conflicts taking place in a country in relation with the number of mentions in the media depending on where the conflict has happened?

### Are we emotionally predictable?
Can we observe patterns of emotions with respect to a country, religion or an ethnical group? Can we derive a model predicting emotions in case of a new conflict based on its specific features?

### How much is too much?
Do we have a saturation limit? Does increasing number of conflicts make people feel worse and worse or is there some limit?

### Hysteric or ice queen?
Are some nations more emotional? Do we see sensitivity differences between some countries or actors?

### With footnotes too!

Back up your stuff with solid, clean citations. Footnotes can be written in markdown and appear like this.[^1] Use as many as you like.[^2]

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### Add social sharing buttons

Simply add the following line anywhere in your markdown:

<pre><code>{% raw  %}
{% include sharing.html %}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

and get a nice responsive sharing ribbon.

{% include sharing.html %}

Add this at the bottom, or the top, or between every other paragraph if you're desprate for social validation.

Just remember to customize the buttons to fit your url in the `_includes/sharing.html` file. These buttons are made available and customizable by the good folks at kni-labs. See the documentation at [https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) for more information.

### Font awesome is also included

<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i> Now you can use all the cool icons you want! [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) is indeed awesome. But wait, you don't need this sweetness and you don't want that little bit of load time from the font awesome css? No problem, just disable it in the `config.yml` file, and it won't be loaded.

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>you can make lists...</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>with cool icons like this,</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>even ones that move!</li>
</ul>

If you need them, you can stick any of the [605 icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) anywhere, with any size you like. ([See documentation](http://fontawesome.io/examples/))

<i class="fa fa-building"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-bus fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-cube fa-2x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa-3x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x">

### Add images to make your point

Images play nicely with this template as well. Add diagrams or charts to make your point, and the template will fit them in appropriately.

<img src="images/hello.svg" alt="sample image">
